### Questions to consider NLP for:
1. 2.2a 'Impact Description' (Kolkata 2018) -- Emissions
2. 5.2 'Project Description' (Kolkata 2018) -- Opportunities
3. 2.0a 'Risk Assessment methodology description' (All 2019) -- Vulnerability
4. 2.1 'Climate Hazards descriptions/explanations' (All 2019) -- Vulnerability (Indore very verbose!)
5. 2.2 'Factors affecting ability to adapt to climate change' (Indore 2019)
6. 6.0 'Opportunities' descriptions (All 2019)
7. 14.3a 'Water Risk Descriptions' (Indore 2019)
8. 14.4 'Actions to be taken for water supply risk reduction' descriptions (All 2019)

## Notable Statistics:
### 2018:
1. green jobs (Jaipur = 1000, Chennai = 5)
2. only Chennai has a credit rating!
3. Lots of projects underway in Kolkata but Jaipur and Chennai disclose too
* Physical infrastructure investment, relief funds (for NGOs), solar equipment, rainwater harvesting, green building, green transport systems
4. Potable water (% of city)? (Jaipur = 70)
5. Water metering (mandatory in Delhi & Jaipur, nonexistent in Chennai & Kolkata)
6. only Kolkata foresees substantial risks to water supply
7. KOlkata 3rd most vulnerable city in world to coastal flooding
8. 53% of boroughs have >0.13mts/yr ground water decline
9. Kolkata water strategies: stormwater mgmt, regulations on ground water use and mandatory rainwater harvesting structures for high rises
10. wastewater service (% of city)? (Jaipur = 60)
11. Chennai handles sewage, sink water, and industrial fully, but collects 0% runoff/stormwater

### 2019:
1. Emissions reporting protocol (mostly GPC, Delhi & Indore use old 2006 IPCC, Kochi uses new US ICLEI)
2. Nagpur is reporting N20 levels (not CO2)
3. Chennai LIED and said again that it was its first year so no changes in emission. Nagpur and Rajkot saw increases of 133k tonnes?
4. Why no verification? (Nagpur -- no internal verification, Rajkot -- lack of funding)
5. Different risk assessment methodologies used (UNDP, Sendai, ASDMA, NESAC, ICLEI, CVACC)

### 2020:
1. Chennai includes more gases than Delhi (PFCs, NF3, SF6) on top of basics (N2O, CO2, HFCs, CH4)
2. Chennai has NO strategies in place to reduce consumption GHG emissions in Food, Construction, Transportation, Clothing & Textiles, Electronics, Aviation
